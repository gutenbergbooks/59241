<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">WUPATKI NATIONAL MONUMENT</span></h2>
<p class="center small">An unusual stone pueblo built by Indian farmers of the 12th century</p>
<p class="tb">The red sandstone prehistoric pueblos
of Wupatki, gleaming against a background
of black basaltic cliffs and facing
a view of the Painted Desert of the Little
Colorado River, were built by groups
of farming Indians, ancestors of the picturesque
Hopis. More than 800 home
sites have been discovered in the monument,
varying from the pits of ancient
earth lodges to house structures three
stories high. Studies of ancient wooden
beams in the ruins have dated the major
occupation as occurring during the eleventh
and twelfth centuries.</p>
<p>These abundant prehistoric ruins constitute
the tangible and colorful remains of
an eleventh-century Indian &ldquo;land rush&rdquo;
that resulted from the earlier eruption of
Sunset Crater, a nearby volcano.</p>
<p>Coming from several directions and
bringing different customs and habits, the
various tribes met and mixed, though remaining
in large part distinct groups,
forming a local cultural pattern differentiated
from its contemporaries in other
sections of the prehistoric American
Southwest.</p>
<p>The many ruins in Wupatki National
Monument are in an unusual state of
preservation. The most accessible are the
Citadel and Wupatki, located 5 and 14
miles, respectively, from U. S. Highway 89.</p>
<h3 id="c2">The Eruption and the Land Rush</h3>
<p>Prior to the eruption of Sunset Crater,
the vast area from the San Francisco
Peaks to the Little Colorado River was
sparsely inhabited due to scarcity of rainfall
for raising crops. A few families were
scattered along the base of the peaks where
abundant snow and frequent summer rains
made farming possible.</p>
<p>Between 1046 and 1071 A. D., or almost
1,000 years ago, there were rumblings in
the valley at the foot of the peaks. Earth
lodges abandoned by the frightened Indians
decayed into ruins. Then came the
eruption of what is now Sunset Crater.
Huge clouds of volcanic cinder or ash
buried remains of the homes and spread
a black mantle over more than 800 square
miles of territory between the mountains
and the river.</p>
<p>While this was probably regarded as a
great catastrophe at the time, some of the
Indians soon discovered it was possible to
raise corn where plants previously had
shriveled and died from lack of water.
The fine layer of cinder over the soil
formed a mulch which absorbed moisture
from the scanty rain and snow. Gradually
news of this new farming land filtered
out over the Southwest. The land rush
was on.</p>
<h3 id="c3">The People</h3>
<p>Here truly was a &ldquo;melting pot.&rdquo; Indian
families came from the north, south, east,
and west. In the cinder-covered area is
the only place where we find the Pueblo
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
dry farmer from eastern and northern
Arizona mingling with the Hohokam irrigation
farmer from the south; where there
are strong influences from the Mogollon
groups to the south and east along with
those from a more backward and, as yet,
little-known people from the west.</p>
<p>Each tribe came with their precious corn
seed and digging sticks to cultivate the
cinder soils. They met and mingled.
In the earlier village ruins it is possible to
distinguish these various people by characteristic
styles of their utensils, tools, and
weapons, but as time went on these differences
became less and less apparent.</p>
<h3 id="c4">The Villages</h3>
<p>Villages were developed throughout
the cinder-covered area. One of the most
important and longest inhabited of these
was a ruin which is now called Wupatki&mdash;a
Hopi Indian word for &ldquo;Tall House.&rdquo;
Here was a spring, one of the few in this
arid region.</p>
<p>Wupatki is one of the most spectacular
pueblos in northern Arizona. Its sandstone
walls rise from a sandstone spur at
the base of a black lava mesa that overlooks
the Painted Desert. From an insignificant
pueblo of a few rooms, Wupatki
grew until it became the largest in
the region. During the 1100&rsquo;s it contained
more than 100 rooms, was in places
at least three stories high, and had an estimated
population of from 150 to 200 persons.
To one side of the ruin, protected
from the prevailing winds, was an open-air
amphitheater which apparently was
used for public ceremonies. In the valley
below is a &ldquo;ball court,&rdquo; the only stone-masonry
one that has been discovered in
the Southwest. Little is known of the
game itself, but it was very popular in
southern Arizona and was brought up by
migrants from that region. Wupatki was
partially excavated and a few of the rooms
restored by the Museum of Northern Arizona
in cooperation with the National
Park Service in 1933-34.</p>

<p>Around the Citadel was another concentration
of prehistoric Indians. Within a
square mile there are more than 100 sites,
varying in size from earth lodges to the
larger pueblos. The Citadel itself, as yet
unexcavated, is a fortified apartment
house. Probably it was once two stories
high and contained nearly 50 rooms. Its
impregnable position on top of a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
lava-capped mesa, overlooking a wide expanse
of country, suggests that it served as
a retreat during times of stress. Numerous
loop-holes through the thick walls
strengthen this impression. On the terraced
slopes of the mesa are circles of
boulders, the remains of more temporary
homes. It is possible that the Citadel was
built to guard a water supply that existed
in the nearby limestone sinkhole.</p>
<p>Just below the Citadel is the small pueblo
now called Nalakihu, a Hopi word
for &ldquo;House Standing Alone.&rdquo; It, like
Wupatki, was excavated and partially restored
in 1934.</p>
<p>Other outstanding ruins in the monument
are Wukoki ruin, another fortified
apartment house; and Crack-in-the-Rock
ruin near the Little Colorado River. To
reach these more inaccessible ruins, it is
necessary to make arrangements with the
custodian in Wupatki ruin.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Abandonment</h3>
<p>All of the ruins were abandoned in the
1200&rsquo;s. This is accounted for, partly at
least, by several factors&mdash;high winds
sweeping the moisture-conserving cinder
fields, climatic changes, and disease among
the Indians. It brought to a close one of
the unique chapters of Southwestern
archeology. Probably among the present
day Hopis the descendants of these people
are to be found.</p>
<p>Drought and disease, possibly also attacks
of nomad enemies, caused the abandonment
by the Pueblos of most of northern
Arizona during the thirteenth century.
This region, the Tsegi region (Navajo National
Monument and vicinity), and the
region of Canyon de Chelly National Monument
were deserted. The survivors from
all these areas must have congregated at
the Hopi mesas, where the springs never
fail. Later, in the fourteenth century,
the great pueblos of Chaves Pass and
Homolovi (near Winslow, Ariz.) and of
the Verde Valley (notably Tuzigoot and
Montezuma Castle National Monuments)
were abandoned, their people going northeast
to swell the Hopi nation. When the
Spaniards arrived in 1540 there were no
pueblo villages occupied in Arizona save
those of the Hopi, in Tusayan.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Citadel</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c6">Tree-Ring Dates</h3>
<p>The time of occupation of each ruin in
this region is fairly well known, through
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
the tree-ring method of dating prehistoric
sites. The date of eruption of Sunset
Crater is approximately known, from the
dating by the tree-ring method of houses
built before and after the cinder fall.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Nearby Points of Interest</h3>
<p>By visiting Sunset Crater, Wupatki, and
Walnut Canyon National Monuments, and
also the Museum of Northern Arizona in
Flagstaff, Ariz., visitors can obtain first-hand
knowledge of one of the most interesting
localities in the United States. The
story of each area is linked with the others.
The Museum of Northern Arizona has
been instrumental in searching out the scientific
facts concerning the manifestations
of nature and man in the region and displays
interesting exhibits which help to
explain them. The exhibits to be installed
by the National Park Service at
Walnut Canyon and Wupatki will be
specifically explanatory of the monuments;
the Museum of Northern Arizona presents
a picture of the entire region.</p>
<h3 id="c8">How to Get to Wupatki</h3>
<p>Wupatki National Monument is easily
approached from U. S. Highway 89 at a
point 22 miles north of its junction with
U. S. Highway 66, 6 miles east of Flagstaff,
and 23 miles south of its junction with
State Highway 64 close to Cameron.
Roads within the monument are not improved.
There is also another entrance
road from Sunset Crater National Monument.
However, it is one-way, runs
through deep cinder, and is not advisable
for drivers unaccustomed to this type of
road. It is generally impassable in winter.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Administration</h3>
<p>Wupatki National Monument was established
in 1924 by Presidential proclamation
and contains 34,693 acres of Federally
owned land. It is a part of the
National Park System, owned by the people
of the United States and administered
for them by the National Park Service of
the Department of the Interior. In these
areas the scenery and the objects of historic,
prehistoric, and scientific interest are
carefully preserved and displayed for public
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Free guide service is available at
Wupatki Ruin from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. No
accommodations for visitors are provided
at the monument, but such facilities may
be obtained at either Flagstaff or Cameron,
each approximately 40 miles away.
Lunches may be purchased at a few points
along Highway 89.</p>
<p>Please help us take care of the monument
by observing the rules which have
been devised for its preservation and protection.
Do not collect souvenirs. Leave
all natural phenomena and archeological
remains unharmed for others to enjoy.
To preserve the ruins and for your own
safety do not walk on prehistoric walls.
Stay on established trails. Keep on the
main traveled roads and drive carefully.
Remember all National Park areas are
wildlife sanctuaries. So do not hunt.
Keep dogs on leash.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
